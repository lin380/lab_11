## Preparation

- Read/ annotate: [Recipe \#11](https://lin380.github.io/tadr/articles/recipe_11.html). You can refer back to this document to help you at any point during this lab activity.
- Note: do your best to employ what you've learned and use other existing resources (R documentation, web searches, etc.).

## Objectives

- Gain experience working with coding strategies to prepare, feature engineer, explore, and evaluate results from exploratory data analyses.
- Practice transforming datasets into new object formats and visualizing relationships
- Implement organizational strategies for organizing and reporting results in a reproducible fashion.

## Instructions

In this lab we will be exploring tweets collected from the Twitter API between October 14 to 25, 2021 for the search terms: faucet, spigot, frying pan, skillet, pail, bucket, coke, pop, soda, you guys, y'all, yall.

In this lab the code has been provided in the file `lab_11.Rmd`. You task will be to add the relevant prose to describe the steps as if it were part of your research project.

### Tasks

1. Change the `author: "<Your Name Here>"` line in the front matter to reflect your name.

2. Add descriptive prose to the `lab_11.Rmd` script to describe each of the code chunks that implement coding steps for producing this analysis and their output results. 

3. As always, provide a self-assessment of your progress in this lab.

Some questions to consider: 

  - What did you learn?
  - What was most/ least challenging?
  - What resources did you consult? 
  - What more would you like to know about?
